## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m a student at Holberton School Australia, undertaking a nine-month full-stack engineering course that I will be finishing mid-November 2024! My background is in Swiss Law / Economics, and I have a decade of experience working in the corporate world. 

- So far, we have learnt shell scripting and the basics of programming in C, followed by Python, Flask, and NodeJS for the backend, MySQL and MongoDB for databases, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I have also dabbled in Tableau, Kotlin, and Django and have plenty of experience with Excel.
  
- For our final project at Holberton, we developed a web application called "Share Circle" using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). Over the course of two months, we implemented a database, set up the backend with Node.js and Express, and created an interactive frontend with React.
