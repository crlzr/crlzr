## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**crlzr/crlzr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a student at Holberton School Australia, undertaking a 9-month full stack engineering course! My background is in Swiss Law / Economics and I have a decade of experience working in the corprorate world. 

- ðŸŒ± So far, we have learnt the basics of programming in C, followed by Python, Flask and NodeJS for the backend, MySQL for databases, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend. I have also dabbled in Tableau (which is fun!) and have plenty of experience with Excel.
