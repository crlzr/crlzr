## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- From Feb 2024 - Nov 2024 I studied fullstack engineering at Holberton School Australia. My background is in Swiss Law / Economics, and I have a decade of experience working in the corporate world. 

- During our course, we have learnt shell scripting and the basics of programming in C, followed by Python, Flask, and NodeJS for the backend, MySQL and MongoDB for databases, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I have also dabbled in Tableau, Kotlin, and Django and have plenty of experience with Excel.
  
- For our final project at Holberton, we developed a web application called "Share Circle" using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). Over two months, we implemented a database, set up the backend with Node.js and Express, and created an interactive frontend with React.
